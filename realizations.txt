1. It turns out that I require a lot of warm up, similar to what's found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdB1HMCldJY

Difference being:

I need to do each section of the body separately warming up before each section.

And I need to run through the stretches twice for each part of the body.

This means it takes a long time to warm up and stretch.

But the benefits are worth it.

Once I'm in better shape, I believe this need will abate.  But for now focusing on flexability and cardio is essential.
