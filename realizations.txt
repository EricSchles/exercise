1. It turns out that I require a lot of warm up, similar to what's found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdB1HMCldJY

Difference being:

I need to do each section of the body separately warming up before each section.

And I need to run through the stretches twice for each part of the body.

This means it takes a long time to warm up and stretch.

But the benefits are worth it.

Once I'm in better shape, I believe this need will abate.  But for now focusing on flexability and cardio is essential.  

2. Once I've met my calorie count for the day or number of meals, every time I feel "hungry" I'm actually just very thursty.  If I drink a full bottle of water then I stop being hungry.

3. Eating meat once a day helps a lot with cutting total calories.  I don't think I can safely go below that.
